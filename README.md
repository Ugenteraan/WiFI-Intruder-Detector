# WiFi-Intruder-Detector

This is just a fun project. Just change the local IP address at line 14 of ```scanner.py``` and you're good to go.

TODO:
	1) Logic to run the script in the background indefinitely.
	2) Alert box to alert the user when an intruder is detected in the network.

Happy Learning!
